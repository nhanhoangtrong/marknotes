# Request

## Libraries

* [`request`]: Simplified HTTP request client.
* [`request-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise): The simplified HTTP request client 'request' with Promise support. Powered by Bluebird.
* [`request-progress`]: Tracks the download progress of a request made with mikeal/request, giving insight of various metrics including progress percent, download speed and time remaining
* [`got`]: A nicer interface to the built-in http module. It supports following redirects, promises, streams, retries, automagically handling gzip/deflate and some convenience options. Created because [`request`][request] is bloated (several megabytes!).
